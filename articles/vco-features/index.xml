      <description>Although vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) has provided API documentation built-in to the server, it was static content that could not be quickly used for tests or building queries. When a product provides a nice API explorer that not only tells you the available urls and basic docs, but also provides a web-based UI that allows you to quickly build up custom calls and shows you the generated content, the consumption and integration time for developers is reduced considerably.</description>

      <description>Last week I was member of a roundtable for designing SAP application delivery. The main things they discussed about were VM templates and their clones. SAP has an own application abstraction layer (ACC - adaptive computing controller) which hosts an API. With this knowledge I designed a little whiteboard workflow with the vCenter Orchestrator as clone intelligence and automation instance for future release management.
  As you can see the software delivery application could be every other deployment system (HP Radia, Altiris etc.</description>

      <description>Are you getting started with VMware&amp;rsquo;s vCenter Orchestrator? vCO can be a challenge or a breeze to learn depending on your skill sets and what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to accomplish. It allows for the creation of very complicated workflows with minimal effort if you know where to look and are familiar with the interface. Knowing where to look can sometimes be key.
I&amp;rsquo;ve launched this site in an effort to help enlighten those getting started with vCO so I welcome your feedback.</description>
