      <description>I use Text To Speech (TTS) pretty regularly on MacOS to read content to me with a simply key combination. Up until recently, that was the extent of my interest or need in it.
My wife was interested in creating short english lesson videos in a cartoon format, but neither of us wanted to act out the character voices. Enter TTS. This took place in the beginning of September so we started looking around for a nice Text To Speech solution.</description>
