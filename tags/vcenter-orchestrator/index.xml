      <description>Are you getting started with VMware&amp;rsquo;s vCenter Orchestrator? vCO can be a challenge or a breeze to learn depending on your skill sets and what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to accomplish. It allows for the creation of very complicated workflows with minimal effort if you know where to look and are familiar with the interface. Knowing where to look can sometimes be key.
I&amp;rsquo;ve launched this site in an effort to help enlighten those getting started with vCO so I welcome your feedback.</description>
