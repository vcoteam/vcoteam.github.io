      <title>How to Disable Storage I/O Stats Collection with PowerCLI or vRO</title>

      <description>I recently came across a thread asking about how to disable Storage I/O Statistics Collection using PowerCLI. The thread referenced this article by Michael Webster: Disable SIOC IO Metrics Collection For Auto Tiering Storage Systems. In one of the comments, someone asked about using PowerCLI.. Unfortunately there was no answer there so I thought - I might be able to figure this out! With regards to checking that box, I can&amp;rsquo;t say whether it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea or not, my purpose here was just to illustrate how to do it via PowerCLI and vRO.</description>

      <description>Two years ago, I wrote a similar article around vCAC&amp;rsquo;s embedded vCO but a lot has changed since then so those older steps no longer apply. This brief article will quickly walk you through the steps required to allow vRealize Automation 7.0/7.1/7.2&amp;rsquo;s embedded vRealize Orchestrator to allow Active Directory Domain accounts login to the vRO Client.
Pre-Requisites This article assumes the following:
 vRealize Automation 7.0-7.2 is installed and configured (NOTE: This has not been tested with 7.</description>

      <title>How to limit number of workflow tokens</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/articles/learn-vco/311-how-to-limit-number-of-workflow-tokens.html</link>

      <description>Each time vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) runs a workflow, a token (workflow execution) is added beneath the workflow in the vRO client. By default vRO will keep up to 100 of these tokens! This may be a slight annoyance to people who are only interested in the last 5-20 runs. This article will shed some light on the configuration options you have available to you.
Tired of seeing too many workflow tokens?</description>

      <title>Introducing Swagger UI on vRO 7.0.1</title>

      <description>Although vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) has provided API documentation built-in to the server, it was static content that could not be quickly used for tests or building queries. When a product provides a nice API explorer that not only tells you the available urls and basic docs, but also provides a web-based UI that allows you to quickly build up custom calls and shows you the generated content, the consumption and integration time for developers is reduced considerably.</description>

      <title>Synchronize Presentation Settings from embedded workflow</title>

      <description>VMware&amp;rsquo;s vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) is all about modular, reusable components. Many times you wish to call an existing workflow from your own custom workflow but don&amp;rsquo;t want to manually re-create all the different presentation settings. It&amp;rsquo;s not such a big task if there are only one or two workflows, but how about when there are 10+ ? Good news is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to! This quick little video demonstrates how to Synchronize the Presentation of an embedded workflow to your own.</description>

      <title>Creating json objects in Orchestrator</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/articles/learn-vco/305-creating-json-objects-in-orchestrator.html</link>

      <description>Recently I saw a pair of articles by @RoeyAzroel on vRO XML &amp;amp; JSON Gotcha! - Part 1 and Part 2. This reminded me that I had some sample code that I refer to when working with json as well so figured I would share here.
Be sure you know about the JSON object and its .parse and .stringify methods since they do not appear anywhere in the Orchestrator&amp;rsquo;s API explorer or documentation.</description>

      <description>In part 1 and part 2 we created the inventory objects, in part 3 we created methods for this objects and ran a generic workflow to run these methods.
In this article we will create workflows for calling these methods, include them in a package with all the plug-in configuration to ship it to our end users.
Creating the workflows The invoke workflows in the plug-in facilitate running REST operations. End users and or external system will expect simpler workflows.</description>

      <description>Part 1 of the plug-in generator v2 series covered how to create new plug-in inventory types, part 2 how to create their child object types. This part will focus on how to define object methods and associated workflows. Having Orchestrator inventory types is a necessity to use with vRealize Automation (formerly vCAC) Advanced Service Designer. Once you have these inventory objects you may wonder how to use these in workflows. This is what this article covers.</description>

      <description>In the part 1 I walk through step by step to create a plug-in object type leveraging the Plug-in Generator version 2.
In this article I will demonstrate one of the new feature of this version 2 : Create a child object type.
Having the plug-in inventory organized in a tree view allows to represent most of the objects hierarchies found in applications APIs.
Resuming from part 1 I need to create a vNIC object.</description>
