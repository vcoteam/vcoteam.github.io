      <description>I use Text To Speech (TTS) pretty regularly on MacOS to read content to me with a simply key combination. Up until recently, that was the extent of my interest or need in it.
My wife was interested in creating short english lesson videos in a cartoon format, but neither of us wanted to act out the character voices. Enter TTS. This took place in the beginning of September so we started looking around for a nice Text To Speech solution.</description>

      <description>In my efforts to learn more in the Cloud Native Apps space, I recently attended DockerCon 2018 and have been playing around with Docker a bit so I get the basics. Since VMware has Pivotal Container Services (PKS) for self-hosted enterprise ready Kubernetes and VMware Kubernetes Engine (VKE) as an upcoming SaaS offering, I figured it was time to start getting a feel for Kubernetes.
Docker Training For the first two days of DockerCon, I opted for the Docker Fundamentals training as an add-on.</description>

      <description>A power outage recently made a mess of my home lab due to a resulting issue with VSAN. As a result, I needed to setup a fresh Virtual Center Server Appliance (VCSA), but my DNS server was on the VSAN! vCenter now requires working DNS resolution during install&amp;hellip; What to do??
Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been getting started with Docker so figured this would be a good opportunity to use that to address an immediate need that I, and potentially others, would need: A quick and easy lightweight DNS server that could be used for resolving my lab domain.</description>

      <description>Last week, I was leading discussions at a Technical session for VMware&#39;s internal TechSummit event in Toronto, Canada. During one of the discussions, we ended up on the topic of where and how we were storing workflows and packages we had developed. I was a bit surprised that people in the room had workflows and packages in GitHubreposbut weren&#39;t aware of some aspects of the Sample Exchange at the VMware Code site!</description>

      <description>On the VMware blog I have explained how vRealize Automation Anything as a Service (XaaS) work with Orchestrator and how a vRO plug-in works.
In this tutorial I will walk you through how I managed to implement Microsoft DNS as a service I used for the screenshot examples on that blog including:
 The Microsoft DNS dynamic types plug-in DNS record as a service in vRA DNS record as a blueprint component  This is the first public tutorial on how to create a Dynamic Types plug-in from scratch and the overall methodology used applies to other integrations.</description>

      <description>In a previous article, I taught you How to retrieve a script Resource from vRO via curl. That can be helpful to some people, but how about updating that script? Easy! Read on&amp;hellip;
This is a super short post since all the tough details were already outlined in the article linked above. So, assuming you already know the ID and name of the script you wish to update, all you need to do is run the following curl command:</description>

      <description>I recently spent time with a customer doing a vRO workshop with them. During the course of the workshop, I was asked how you could retrieve a script that had been stored as a resource element on a vRO server using curl. Well, I had never done that before so I set out to figure it out and was able to provide the solution before I left! Throughout this article, I will be using a vRA 7.</description>

      <description>In a previous article VMworld 2016 Barcelona Hackathon, I noted that I had won an i3 NUC at VMworld in Barcelona. After playing with that for a few days and helping Alan Renouf test his Home Lab Deployment Script, I decided I wanted to have a full 3 node cluster - but with the i5 Processor &amp;hellip; so, I went shopping!

      <description>I recently came across a thread asking about how to disable Storage I/O Statistics Collection using PowerCLI. The thread referenced this article by Michael Webster: Disable SIOC IO Metrics Collection For Auto Tiering Storage Systems. In one of the comments, someone asked about using PowerCLI.. Unfortunately there was no answer there so I thought - I might be able to figure this out! With regards to checking that box, I can&amp;rsquo;t say whether it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea or not, my purpose here was just to illustrate how to do it via PowerCLI and vRO.</description>

      <description>The Intel NUC has become a popular device for a variety of use cases. It&amp;rsquo;s quite a powerful little box that can be used as a regular Windows/Linux machine, a Home Theater PC (HTPC), or a techie Test/Dev box for many different types of software, including VMware ESXi - and even vSAN! This will be a short blog post on setting up a USB boot stick for the installation of ESXi on a SanDisk Ultra Fit 16GB USB.</description>

      <description>Two years ago, I wrote a similar article around vCAC&amp;rsquo;s embedded vCO but a lot has changed since then so those older steps no longer apply. This brief article will quickly walk you through the steps required to allow vRealize Automation 7.0/7.1/7.2&amp;rsquo;s embedded vRealize Orchestrator to allow Active Directory Domain accounts login to the vRO Client.

      <title>How to limit number of workflow tokens</title>
      <link>http://www.vcoteam.info/articles/learn-vco/311-how-to-limit-number-of-workflow-tokens.html</link>

      <guid>http://www.vcoteam.info/articles/learn-vco/311-how-to-limit-number-of-workflow-tokens.html</guid>
      <description>Each time vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) runs a workflow, a token (workflow execution) is added beneath the workflow in the vRO client. By default vRO will keep up to 100 of these tokens! This may be a slight annoyance to people who are only interested in the last 5-20 runs. This article will shed some light on the configuration options you have available to you.
Tired of seeing too many workflow tokens?</description>

      <description>Although vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) has provided API documentation built-in to the server, it was static content that could not be quickly used for tests or building queries. When a product provides a nice API explorer that not only tells you the available urls and basic docs, but also provides a web-based UI that allows you to quickly build up custom calls and shows you the generated content, the consumption and integration time for developers is reduced considerably.</description>

To do so I am leveraging:
 vSphere guest operations allowing to run commands in the guest OS even if it is not networked yet. NetworkManager / nmcli which provides a command line way to get and set a broad set of network configurations that can be applied immediately and permanently .</description>

      <description>vCenter 6 has introduced an important new feature for anyone interested in Automation and integration : a REST based endpoint providing access to some of the recent functionality such as the tagging service, the content library and transfer service : It is called &amp;ldquo;VMware vCloud Suite SDK&amp;rdquo; and codenamed vAPI. In addition to the REST API it provides language bindings for Java, Python, .NET, Perl and Ruby. If you want to know more about vAPI you can read the blog article I wrote on the VMware CTO Ambassadors blog.</description>

      <description>VMware&amp;rsquo;s vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) is all about modular, reusable components. Many times you wish to call an existing workflow from your own custom workflow but don&amp;rsquo;t want to manually re-create all the different presentation settings. It&amp;rsquo;s not such a big task if there are only one or two workflows, but how about when there are 10+ ? Good news is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to! This quick little video demonstrates how to Synchronize the Presentation of an embedded workflow to your own.</description>

Be sure you know about the JSON object and its .parse and .stringify methods since they do not appear anywhere in the Orchestrator&amp;rsquo;s API explorer or documentation.</description>

 Understanding how vCO does the API calls Troubleshoot a problem with a target host Re-engineering an existing call with capturing it, changing it as you like and use it via the REST or SOAP plug-in Brag you have found an &amp;ldquo;Onyx&amp;rdquo; like functionality for most Orchestrated products  This article will guide you on how to log these calls to a file.</description>

      <description>In previous tutorials we created inventory object types, their children objects, workflows to operate these that we packaged for our end users.
In this tutorial we are going to create an orchestrator plug-in to list vCO / vRO workflows ! You may wonder why doing so ?
This is a good use case for leveraging some of the more advanced features of the plug-in generator v2 to handle complex REST APIs and improving performance when needed.</description>

This part will focus on how to define object methods and associated workflows. Having Orchestrator inventory types is a necessity to use with vRealize Automation (formerly vCAC) Advanced Service Designer. Once you have these inventory objects you may wonder how to use these in workflows. This is what this article covers.</description>

      <description>In the part 1 I walk through step by step to create a plug-in object type leveraging the Plug-in Generator version 2.
In this article I will demonstrate one of the new feature of this version 2 : Create a child object type.
Having the plug-in inventory organized in a tree view allows to represent most of the objects hierarchies found in applications APIs.
Resuming from part 1 I need to create a vNIC object.</description>

      <description>In a previous article I have explained how Dynamic Types work and how these are very useful to create a vCO / vRO plugin that will enable the XaaS capabilitites of vCAC / vRA.
Then explained how to build your own twitter plug-in using the plug-in generator package. I have now extended the capabilities of the plug-in generator and will attempt to demonstrate these in this new series of articles. This article use NSX as the orchestrated endpoint but following the explanation included on this tutorial you should be able to get it to work with many REST web service.</description>

For this article, I followed the same format as the previous two BUT provided the option to call the script with command line parameters! You may download the script in this article from my vroClientScripts Repository on GitHub.

      <description>vRealize Orchestrator (vRO) is frequently used with Network related automation which may involve working with IP Addresses. From an end user perspective, it is nice to specify a range of addresses such as 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.100 rather than having to specify all addresses. I found some simple Javascript in this Converting IP Addresses article that is easily adapted to vRO. You can use the code included in this article to either return an array of addresses in the range specified, or simplify it by returning the total number of addresses in the range.</description>

      <description>Welcome back! This is the second article of a multi-part series that steps you through the process of mapping a SQL table into vRealize Orchestrator, building out a DynamicTypes plug-in inventory based on that table, then exposing it to vRealize Automation&amp;rsquo;s Advanced Service Designer (ASD). In the first article, we got our database table mapped using the SQL Plug-in and generated some CRUD workflows.
Introduction Let&amp;rsquo;s build a simple Dynamic Types plug-in around our SQL Table that we created in our previous article.</description>

      <description>A frequent requirement when performing orchestration tasks is to have input fields interdependent. For example, if I input XYZ into the first input, I want the second input to be relevant to XYZ. In the past, I have frequently done such workflows where you select a Datacenter for the first input, then the second input would present a list of Datastores (or VMs or Clusters or Hosts). In this tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;m going to do something a little different.</description>

      <description>My colleague, Chris Slater at defined by software has published an article on how to extend VMware Automation Center (vCAC) with F5 firewall functionality. I usually do not cross post articles but this one is worth mentioning since it is a real world example on how to leverage vCAC + vCO + Dynamic Types + third party API.
The first part of the article explains the different options available to automate F5 including the F5 plug-in for vCO, PowerShell, the big IP CLI, the SOAP and REST APIs and give an overview of the solution.</description>

      <description>Last year I have created an extensibility package to simplify and automate the steps necessary to extend the vCAC IaaS lifecycle process with calling out vCO workflows. While this was mainly aimed at accelerating Proof of Concepts it has been since then broadly adopted in production environments. Since vCAC 6.0 it is part of the product and available for vCAC 5.2 as a separate download.
Since this is now becoming a very hot topic I am including here a very useful extensibility introduction video that was released by my colleagues from tech marketing almost three months ago.</description>

      <description>One of the relatively new 5.x features of vCenter Orchestrator (vCO) is the ability to Enable a workflow to resume on failure. Essentially, this means that a workflow could fail 1/2 or 3/4 the way through and you could go and tell vCO to resume that workflow, perhaps after fixing whatever issue caused it to fail in the first place, rather than start a fresh instance of the workflow.
Introduction   As noted in the intro snippet, vCO now has the ability to let you resume a failed workflow.</description>

      <description>In a previous article I have explained how the vCO dynamic Types allow to simplify the development of vCO plug-ins and how these are leveraged by VMware vCloud Automation Center XaaS. It is now time to experiment with creating a plugin with leveraging the Dynamic Types plug-in generator package.
Warning: You can do it without Java development experience and without having to write a single line of scripting !
As a first step download the Dynamic Types plug-in generator package from VMware communities.</description>

      <description>You may have noticed that the vCO 5.5.1 release notes are listing a new feature called &amp;ldquo;Dynamic Types&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Workflow developers are now able to explore the new Dynamic Types which currently is being shipped with Beta quality. They can easily extend vCenter Orchestrator plug-ins by adding their custom types accessible from the scripting API. New types become available in the inventory right after creation and they could be directly leveraged from the vCAC ASD context as part of the cloud provisioning process and XaaS definition.</description>

By default, the vCO Server uses a &amp;ldquo;vcoadmins&amp;rdquo; group in the &amp;ldquo;vsphere.local&amp;rdquo; domain provided by the SSO server that vCAC was configured to use. This short tutorial will step you through a pretty basic configuration where I have just deployed a vCAC 6.</description>

      <description>A frequent question around vCenter Orchestrator is: Can I read/write to shared folders? The answer is always yes, but the documentation may be difficult to find - especially when you are referring to a Windows share - aka CIFS in samba and *nix mounting terminology. Read on to learn EXACTLY what you need to do to allow your vCO server to read/write to a Windows Share!
Overview: vCO allows limited access to its local filesystem.</description>

      <description>This week VMware released vCenter Orchestrator 5.5.1. While this is not a major new release it contains a lot of new features focusing on making vCO content development easier. Also important is a list of deprecated features.
Protocol plug-ins are now included The days where vCO was mainly used to automate vCenter are over. vCO integrates with many third party applications using generic protocol based plug-ins. In previous releases you had to find the latest release, download the plug-ins and install these.</description>

      <description>vCloud Hybrid Service (vCHS) is backed by vCloud Director. What does this mean? Well, it means that once you have defined 1 or more Virtual Data Centers, and VMware releases an updated vCD plug-in, you will have access to a vCloud Director Organization! Why is that good and what is the point of this post? Well, in short, this means you can use vCenter Orchestrator (vCO) to do some automation within your vCHS Virtual Data Centers!</description>

      <description>Have you ever had the need to get some attributes of your Active Directory user account? Perhaps Manager for an approval, maybe direct reports, etc&amp;hellip; but not sure how to work with the AD:User object in vCO&amp;hellip; Well here&amp;rsquo;s a great little snippet that can help you quickly identify the available information attached to the AD:User account you specify.
Show AD User Info  Simply place the following script into a scriptable task in a new workflow.</description>

      <description>Running commands or scripts in VM guest is something that has been done with vCO for quite a while using different mechanisms. A popular way was to use the VIX plug-in for vCO. This plug-in is not needed anymore since the VIX functionality is part of the vCenter API since vCenter 5.0 and there are guest operations workflows to copy a script and run it into a VM guest OS since vCO 5.</description>

      <description>vCenter Orchestrator references workflows by ID and allows to have multiple workflows with the same name. If the workflows you are calling have a unique name you can write a vCO wrapper to find a workflow by name with the following code.
Input: wfName (string)
Output: wfByName (Workflow)
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13  var workflows = Server.findAllForType(&amp;#34;Workflow&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;c.name=&amp;#39;&amp;#34;+wfName+&amp;#34;&amp;#39;&amp;#34;); var wfByName = null; if (workflows !</description>

      <description>When working with new integrations that utilize the vCenter Orchestrator (vCO) REST API you may want additional logging on the vCO side to see what is happening. I came across this need on a recent project. By default, vCO is logging workflow and webview activities but not API calls. This short article walks you through the steps necessary to enable such logging.
The following steps will enable additional logging on your vCO server.</description>

      <description>vCloud Automation Center is the VMware hybrid cloud self-service provisioning portal. It can be customized to extend its OOTB functionality. The following tutorial shows how from the vSphere web client create a menu operation to run a program in a guest or how to do it automatically once the VM has been provisioned. This does not involve any scripting !

      <description>vCloud Automation Center has several constructs such as blueprints, business groups, reservations to manage the virtual machines lifecycle and governance policies.
While most customers will use vCloud Automation Center out of the box some have several use cases for automation and integration. This is where vCenter Orchestrator comes into the picture.
The vCloud Automation Center Infrastructure as a service data model (vCAC IaaS) vCAC IaaS has an extensible model consisting of different metamodels.</description>

      <description>It seems everyday the interest in vCenter Orchestrator (vCO) is growing. I love this because it brings more and more use cases to our attention. One such use case is the need to call vCO workflows via its REST API. In order to keep this article generic, but useful, I will work with the free RESTClient plug-in/add-on for Firefox as the client. The general process here will be similar to what you may need to do from your software or portal to integrate with vCO&amp;rsquo;s REST API.</description>

      <description>On a recent project, I was having trouble figuring out why invoking a SOAP operation kept failing with the vCO SOAP plug-in. The inputs I was providing appeared to be correct and worked just fine with soapUI. This short tutorial will teach you how to use the SOAPInterceptor to display the Header and Body that the SOAP plug-in is sending.

      <title>Making vCO Workflow Wrappers</title>

      <guid>http://www.vcoteam.info/articles/learn-vco/266-making-vco-workflow-wrappers.html</guid>
      <description>A vCO workflow wrapper is a set of workflow tasks that are added at the beginning of a workflow in order to take string values and look up a more complex data type or pre-defining inputs using attributes. You may have done these in the past already in vCO. Some examples would be finding a virtual machine by name or finding an Active Directory user by email address.
If you&amp;rsquo;re running the vCO workflow from within the vCO client or vSphere web client, you probably don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about this as both of those tools understand the complex data types that come with plugins.</description>

      <description>PERL Logo   The goal of this tutorial is to create a simple workflow with a single string input that will be passed to a locally hosted Perl script for execution. The results of the script will be returned to vCO and stored in the workflow output. This could come in handy if you have existing systems that already have Perl based management scripts and you wish to incorporate their automation into your Orchestration policies.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what the project was, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t terribly important so I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother digging deeper to figure things out - I just worked around the issue. Last month William Lam posted an article on how to do this with PERL.

      <description>VMware released vCenter Orchestrator 5.1.1 As part of the vCenter 5.1 update 1. I rarely cover these updates on the blog since they are mostly bug fixes. This one is different since it includes some long due functionalities. I did ask for some of these and the dev team did an awesome job implementing them !
vCenter Orchestrator 5.1 provided a lot of new great features at the workflow designer level and integration with the vSphere web client I have detailed in this article.</description>

      <description>Have you ever read the official vCenter Orchestrator documentation? If not, I strongly recommend you to check it out. On this page (http://www.vmware.com/support/pubs/orchestrator_pubs.html), there is an information treasure of 7 (yes, seven!) guides, which are available in different formats, including mobi and epub, and contain information about every aspect of the Orchestrator configuration and interface.
The only disadvantage of this amazing documentation set is the large number of pages, more than 500, which is the average size of a popular novel.</description>

      <description>As vCloud Automation Center (vCAC) gains traction, so too does the need for details on how to extend it using vCenter Orchestrator (vCO). I have kept an eye out for good articles on vCAC and just saw a great one at the DailyHypervisor.com blog around Adding a computer account to Active Directory OU. This is something that we had done for LifeCycleManager (LCM) quite some time back and feel it is a good candidate for a vCO-centeric article.</description>

Yes, it is 2013 yet there are plenty of reasons why organizations might still be using an Excel spreadsheet instead of a database table.. We won&#39;t dwell on that here, instead we&#39;ll focus on providing those organizations with a step-by-step guide to provide such functionality to vCenter Orchestrator.</description>

vCloud Director 5.1 introduced a new feature called API extensions which basically allows a cloud provider to extend the vCloud Director API with custom services with leveraging VMware or third party applications.</description>

      <description>vCloud Director 5.1 has some new features, one of them allows to keep vApp Templates information that are by default discarded. My colleague William Lam covers this very well in this article. If you think this would be good to have this functionality as a workflow then you can have it in about 5 minutes with creating it on your own.
First thing is there is no out of the box workflow that download a lossless vApp Template but there is one to download a vApp Template.</description>

      <description>Setting metadata on vCloud Director objects is a convenient way to extend their properties with whatever information you need to attach to these. This is very useful to include information on the object lifecycle or to reference other objects. For example I like to reference the vApp Template a vApp was issued from with adding a &#34;vAppTemplateReference&#34; metadata. Another use of the metadata is that you can search for these using the query service.</description>

      <description>VMware has just made available its Orchestration plug-in leveraging vCloud Director 5.1 latest and greatest features. This is the most complete automation solution for vCloud Director and is a free download !
To put things in perspective the 1.0 version of the plug-in was released months after vCloud Director 1.0, the 1.5 release weeks after vCloud Director 1.5, the 5.1 version is released together with vCloud Director 5.1. Kudos to the VMware engineering team who have automated the plug-in build process so much that the plug-in could accomodate the changes in pre-release vCloud Director version so quickly.</description>

      <description>We&#39;ve all seen that vCenter Orchestrator (vCO) is quite powerful in automating many aspects of your Infrastructure through the variety of specific and generic plug-ins. While there are hundreds of workflows and actions for vCenter included in a clean install of vCO, they simply don&#39;t cover every single thing you may want to do. One such example has come up a few times in the VMware Communities: Managing Services. The following article will walk you through creating a simple workflow that allows you to manage services on a specified ESXi (VC:HostSystem) server.</description>

      <description>Question:Just curious if you have ever experienced a lag in what VMware vCenter Orchestrator (vCO) sees in vCloud Director(vCD)? I discovered that the workflows are failing because it seems like the data gets stale. Sometimes the new vAppshows up to vCO and other times it takes time... sometimes it seems like things are completely stale. I waited about30 minutes and it still wasn&#39;t showing up when I queried the vApps available.</description>

      <description>The overall goal of the Custom Deploy vApp workflow is to provide a single call workflow that is capable of instantiating a vApp Template from vCloud Director (vCD) and performing a number of operations on the resulting vApp before actually deploying and powering it on. The workflow is intended to be an example and starting point for deployments that require any or all of these features. It can also be called via 3rd party connectors using the vCenter Orchestrator SOAP API.</description>

      <description>My team and I have helped customers to build private and public clouds using vCenter Orchestrator for the last 5 years. Adding vCloud Director in the picture tremendously helps with providing customers a scalable standardized cloud solution. Most people will think at orchestration as a single entry point on top of the cloud when in fact for several use cases it is recommended to have vCloud Director and vCenter Orchestrator running side by side.</description>

If you do not get exactly what you are looking for, there are chances that some of the existing workflows and actions will contain close enough examples. If you do not find any of these you can still use the API explorer to create your own.</description>

      <description>I will re-iterate what I have said about nine months ago : Today VMware released the most complete automation solution for vCloud Director as a free download ! This is a plug-in for vCenter Orchestrator allowing to orchestrate vCloud Director 1.5 with a large collection of out of the box workflows. The previous version of this plug-in (1.02) is used at several service providers and enterprise customers.
As before in terms of functionality the plug-in allows:</description>

      <description>The vCO appliance makes it very easy to deploy vCenter Orchestrator in minutes. My colleague William Lam went a bit further with providing a script that let you pre-define a lot of the configuration settings.
The script leverage the OVF format to set a number of parameters such as the appliance network settings, placement on the virtual infrastructure datastores and network.
You can find out more about it here.
I am looking forward to see more vCO articles from William since he has a very successful VMware scripting blog with a lot of interesting articles.</description>

      <description>Sometimes the user interfaces are limiting you by design. The APIs are often more permissive and if you know what you are doing you can do great things.
Previously we showed you how to hot clone vCloud Director vApps. We even did a video tutorial for it. Now it is time to do something else the vCloud Director User Interface will not let you do : rename an organization.
My test org has my name so my colleagues know it is mine.</description>

In this series, Sergio steps you through the process of creating a new workflow to power on a VM and send e-mail from scratch. A couple library actions, a decision box, scriptable tasks, and error handling will be used throughout the series. The actions taken during this video series will be common across nearly all custom workflow development you perform in the future so it serves as a great basis to get you started.</description>

      <description>Need vCO to fetch some data from a database for integration purposes ? There is an easy solution with creating a plug-in ...
Jöerg Lew wrote an excellent article on the different options to integrate vCO with a database here. Creating a hibernate based plug-in is definitely the best way to map a database as vCO objects but it is a lot of effort and can get quite complex.
Since there is another much simpler way to create a database plug-in (with read only rights on the database) I thought I should share it.</description>

      <description>You have now no more excuses for not using vCenter Orchestrator: you can now have it up and running in a few minutes.
With the vCenter Orchestrator Virtual Appliance the configuration is now reduced to the bare minimum (on the Windows version there is quite a lot of configuration to do and important pre-requisites including a directory service and database).
This is ideal for loading a vCO dev / test environment (including a mobile lab on your laptop) either by importing the provided OVF in vCenter or in Workstation or Fusion (For fusion you will need to use ovftool in command line).</description>

      <description>In some use cases you may want to customize the name of the workflow run/execution to suit your needs. For example it may be more practical to browse the workflow runs with having the name of the object the operation ran on such as &#34;Deploy vApp tcWebServer&#34; instead of the default &#34;Deploy vApp&#34;. It can also be usefull if you use the workflow run as a way to identify a particular one from an external application having an ID for it.</description>

With hundreds of worfklows and actions to use as building blocks with a vanilla install of vCO, you can be on your way to creating workflows in no time. While it is true that JavaScript is used for the scriptable tasks within Orchestrator, you don&#39;t actually have to write any code for some simple, but functional, workflows.</description>

      <description>Ever wondered how your vCenter Orchestrator is doing on memory usage ? vCenter Orchestrator Java Virtual Machine allocates a default of 2 GB Heap space.
It will consume more heap space as processes are running and will ultimately call the garbage collector to keep in memory only the used items.
If you are running a lot of workflows on your server or if you are experimenting custom workflows and plug-ins you may want to know how much of this memory is consumed.</description>

      <description>I am always asked why choose orchestration over scripting. The short answer is that orchestration has a lot more to offer; the long answer is below.
I started to work in IT in 1995 after getting my analyst-programmer degree. Naturally I used scripted automation right away and never stopped since then. I have used batch, shell, vbscript, kix, perl and various other scripting languages to automate desktop and server automated provisioning and operations in physical and then virtual environments in the early 2000s.</description>

      <guid>http://www.vcoteam.info/articles/newsflash/189-vmware-released-a-vcenter-orchestrator-training-course.html</guid>
      <description>Growing interest in vCenter and vCloud Orchestration has led to the creation of a new training course for vCenter Orchestrator.
This three days hands on training is available in classroom, onsite or online. It is aimed at vCenter Orchestrator beginners and requires vSphere administrators and basic scripting skills. Areas covered are installation and configuration, architecture, use of the library workflows and development of custom workflows interacting with external systems.
For knowing some of the folks involved in designing and giving the course (Brian and J&amp;ouml;rg) we heartily recommend it.</description>

      <description>In a previous article we demonstrated how vCenter Orchestrator can leverage the vCloud Director plug-in to automate tasks or create new functionality by combining them. These workflows are initiated by vCenter Orchestrator.
Now if you would like to have vCO triggering workflows based on vCloud Director events (For example an end user task started from the vCloud Director UI, a system event or a task started from the vCloud API) you will be able to leverage the vCloud Director 1.</description>

      <description>With the increasing popularity of VMware vCenter Orchestrator, there is a growing desire to use it over SSL connections. While vCO supports this type of connectivity out of the box, it is not necessarily pre-configured automatically to have a proper SSL certificate. Regardless of how or where you import the default certificate, you are unlikely to get away from warnings such as:

      <description>VMware just released another new vCenter Orchestrator plug-in. The AMQP plug-in.
Quoting part of the release notes:
The VMware vCenter Orchestrator AMQP plug-in allows organizations to automatically trigger workflows based on AMQP messages. Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is a highly-scalable publish and subscribe message protocol that is increasingly used in cloud architectures. It is the default messaging protocol for vCloud Director 1.5. With the AMQP plug-in, organizations can define policies that automatically trigger specific workflows based on certain AMQP messages.</description>

      <description>A common task among vCenter Orchestrator (vCO) developers is to check the results of workflows that have already executed. This can be done in the vCO Client by clicking the plus sign next to the Workflow you are checking on, but this isn&#39;t always the most desirable method. For instance, you may have a vCO Policy/Task setup to check the executions of other workflows at a recurring interval. The following code can help guide you to gathering the desired information.</description>

      <description>Last week I was member of a roundtable for designing SAP application delivery. The main things they discussed about were VM templates and their clones. SAP has an own application abstraction layer (ACC - adaptive computing controller) which hosts an API. With this knowledge I designed a little whiteboard workflow with the vCenter Orchestrator as clone intelligence and automation instance for future release management.
  As you can see the software delivery application could be every other deployment system (HP Radia, Altiris etc.</description>

      <description>With the new released SOAP/REST plug-in you can automate everything you ever dreamed of! One of my favorite use cases is to automate the VMware Lab Manager operations with the SOAP plug-in. As many of you know the Lab Manager offers 2 API´s: an external and an internal one. The following examples are based on the internal API (https://YourLabManagerServer/LabManager/SOAP/LabmanagerInternal.asmx). This use case shows how to establish the VMware LabManager SOAP connection, create an new configuration, adding a template-based VM to the configuration, deploy the configuration and change the owner of the configuration.</description>

      <description>Thomas Corfmat, the vCenter Orchestrator Product Manager released his first blog article.
Thomas has been with VMware for a few months only but it seems to me this was much longer since he has been very active pushing the product capabilities (i.e vCloud, Cisco UCS, Microsoft AD Plug-ins releases and a lot more to come this year), leading the marketing activities (vCO Achilles&#39;s heal) and with reaching out to customers and partners to make sure we have the best cloud orchestration platform.</description>

      <description>We recently came across a nice little analogy around vCloud Director (vCD) and vCenter Orchestrator (vCO) from one of the folks over at NetApp on their blog. The article &#34;What is vCloud Director, really?&#34; cleverly equates vCD to the manager of an apartment complex and vCO to the maintenance man who does work for the manager and other managers (products). Please take a moment to learn more about vCO through this analogy and see what NetApp has to offer with their plugin for vCO!</description>

      <description>This topic is under discussion at the VMware Communities thread here. In addition to the comments currently there....
You would get started with this task by using one of the &#34;Clone&#34; workflows found in the vCO Workflow Library. There are several to choose from depending on how you wish to do your clone:
Clone virtual machine from propertiesClone virtual machine, no customizationetc...There are also specific workflows for doing Windows Clones with Customization, Linux Clones with Customization, and even Linked Clones.</description>

      <description>With this release vCenter Orchestrator is extending his reach in the automation of the cloud infrastructure with managing the physical infrastructure supporting it. For those that do not know yet it is installed as part of vCenter (starting with version 4.0) and usable at no additional cost. It is the only Orchestrator platform supporting full functionality of vCenter and vCloud Director. With the release of the Cisco UCS Manager the end to end provisioning of physical resources - virtual infrastructure - multi-tenant cloud Organizations, virtual Datacenters, vApps is now possible.</description>

      <description>This article is the first tutorial covering a practical use of the recently released VMware vCloud Director plug-in. It is meant to be educational rather than exhaustive.
A while ago I wanted to make a copy of a running vCloud director vApp. When you use the vCloud Director user interface as an Organization Administrator you have the following options:
Copy operations are grayed out.
While there is certainly a very good reason for not supporting copy of running vApps I wanted to explore this further with leveraging the vCloud API through the vCenter Orchestrator plug-in for vCD.</description>

      <description>These days I had a strange scenario in a large customer environment. Every time I tried to start a workflow via SOAP from a webservice client there was an error. After regarding this in the vCO client I found out that every run from the external webservice client causes the action &#34;getAllVMs&#34; to fail. Disconcertingly the array &#34;VMs&#34; wasn´t filled by the action and there was no error message.The error occurs later in the workflow because of the empty array.</description>

      <description>It has been a while without publishing a tutorial. With the growing activities around vCO the vCO team members have been very busy and doing such tutorials takes a lot of time. Since a lot of you already went through the basics we can now give you some code snippets that you can use in your own workflows. Here is the first one. I will eventually improve the article if people ask for it.</description>

      <description>This is the 2nd part of the previous post Some tips for new vCO plug-in developers (I). These tips are more focused on the workflows than on the plug-in project itself.
Again I&#39;ve grouped them by type.
Workflows &amp;amp; Actions
Start developing workflows as building blocksA building block would be a simple workflow that requires some few input parameters and returns some simple output. If we have a rich (and good) set of building blocks it will be much easier to create higher-level workflows and we will offer the users a better set of tools to compose their own complex workflows.</description>

      <description>Here is a small list of tips for those ones who start with the vCO plug-in development. Some of the tips are just some kind of advice that will help you to keep the things clear. Others may make you think about future and possible problems and how to face them up. And finally some other tips will be useful &#34;just&#34; to avoid simple (~ easy-to-fix) problems usually reported by the QA engineers before the final users.</description>

      <description>vCO is shipped with a large library of actions and workflows for the most common vCenter operations. However since vCenter is extremely rich in terms of features and you may have been in the situation where there is no action or workflow for a given vCenter Operation. Thanks to vCO vCenter plug-in exposing the entire vCenter API as javascript objects and methods you can always explore its API documentation and craft your own actions and workflows.</description>

      <guid>http://www.vcoteam.info/question-answer/development/108-how-can-i-write-to-files.html</guid>
      <description>When scripting workflows in VMware vCenter Orchestrator (vCO) it is often desirable to read or write to local files on the vCO server whether this is a .conf, .txt, .cmd, .bat, .xml, or any other text file. In order to do so, you must be sure to either work with files in a pre-approved folder or add your custom folder to a configuration file.
For full details on the following information, please see page 64 of the vCenter Orchestrator Administration guide, section &#34;</description>

      <description>In part two of this series, you learned how to use a user interaction workflow element to allow for an approver to approve a server request. You also learned that a number of permissions are required throughout vCO in order for the approval to actually perform the server request. It is likely that you would have to modify permissions on several other workflows and actions throughout vCO in order for tutorial 2 to fully work for a non-admin account.</description>

      <description>VMware&#39;s vCenter Orchestrator (vCO) ships with a rich library of workflows and actions. The workflows are often designed to handle a single object instance such as a VM. Technical workflows frequently require selecting several VMs by VM folder, resource pool, or by one of their properties (power state, Operating System, Hardware version ...).
Some of our readers have asked how to deal with selecting VMs for a mass operation workflow. This article should cover the basis required to do so.</description>

      <description>In my previous article How to install vCenter Orchestrator (vCO), I walked you through a screen-by-screen installation of vCO. The only major item lacking from that previous article is the ever-important configuration steps. In the past, many people have had troubles with getting the configuration of vCO correct. This article is an effort to help walk you through each of the screens to provide you insight and recommendations on how to get vCenter Orchestrator configured and working in your environment.</description>

      <description>It is licensed with vCenter. Technically it requires you to have a valid vCenter license key. Depending on the vCenter License Edition, vCO will run in Player mode allowing you to run but not edit workflows, or in Server mode, allowing you to run and edit workflows. vCO runs in Player mode with the vCenter Essential and vCenter Foundation licenses, and runs in Server mode with the Standard and higher licenses.</description>
