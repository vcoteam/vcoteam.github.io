      <guid>http://www.vcoteam.info/question-answer/product/69-how-is-it-licensed-.html</guid>
      <description>It is licensed with vCenter. Technically it requires you to have a valid vCenter license key. Depending on the vCenter License Edition, vCO will run in Player mode allowing you to run but not edit workflows, or in Server mode, allowing you to run and edit workflows. vCO runs in Player mode with the vCenter Essential and vCenter Foundation licenses, and runs in Server mode with the Standard and higher licenses.</description>

      <description>They do a combination of the following:
The run some of the library high level workflows.Automate vCenter tasks, such as chaining repetitive operations in workflows. For example, automating the VM provisioning process.Integrate VMware operations with their databases, change management and ticketing systems.Create high-level workflows that involve different approvals and operations from different teams.Provision the virtual infrastructure. For example adding hosts, creating and configuring clusters and resource pools.</description>

      <guid>http://www.vcoteam.info/question-answer/product/60-what-does-vco-do-.html</guid>
      <description>vCO allows you to design and run IT process automation workflows. For example, you can run high-level process workflows, such as a complex provisioning process that includes several technical sub-workflows, such as a workflow to clone a vCenter virtual machine.
Some basic ideas include:Get all VMs for a specified Folder/ResourcePool/Datacenter and then:Cleanup all the old snapshotsDisconnect all removable mediaMigrate VM Templates from host that is going to be put into Maintenance modeThe possibilities are endless.</description>
