      <description>Question:Just curious if you have ever experienced a lag in what VMware vCenter Orchestrator (vCO) sees in vCloud Director(vCD)? I discovered that the workflows are failing because it seems like the data gets stale. Sometimes the new vAppshows up to vCO and other times it takes time... sometimes it seems like things are completely stale. I waited about30 minutes and it still wasn&#39;t showing up when I queried the vApps available.</description>

      <description>This topic is under discussion at the VMware Communities thread here. In addition to the comments currently there....
You would get started with this task by using one of the &#34;Clone&#34; workflows found in the vCO Workflow Library. There are several to choose from depending on how you wish to do your clone:
Clone virtual machine from propertiesClone virtual machine, no customizationetc...There are also specific workflows for doing Windows Clones with Customization, Linux Clones with Customization, and even Linked Clones.</description>

      <description>When scripting workflows in VMware vCenter Orchestrator (vCO) it is often desirable to read or write to local files on the vCO server whether this is a .conf, .txt, .cmd, .bat, .xml, or any other text file. In order to do so, you must be sure to either work with files in a pre-approved folder or add your custom folder to a configuration file.
For full details on the following information, please see page 64 of the vCenter Orchestrator Administration guide, section &#34;</description>

      <description>Creating webviews can be a daunting task. Your best bet to get started is by downloading the vCenter Orchestrator Developer&#39;s guide and going to page 298. Then, follow the step-by-step instructions on how to Create a Simple Web View Using the Default Template. The guide provides a wealth of information around the technology used in vCO webviews as well as sample usage and syntax.
In addition to the resource mentioned above, we recently published part 3 in our series on a self service provisioning portal that includes step by step details on creating a webview.</description>
